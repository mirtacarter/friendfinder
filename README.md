# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

Friend Finder is a compatibility-based "friend matching" application utilizing Express to handle routing. Users begin by completing a survey consisting of 10 questions, indicating whether they agree or disagree with the statement on a scale of 1 to 5. Compatibility is calculated by comparing the user's score against potential BFFs. Once a match has been made, the user will be presented with the name and picture of their new BFF.
